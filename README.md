- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
 I use reactjs for this project because it is more flexible, easy to maintain, and ease to understand.

- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
 If I have more time, i would probably add more features like, search and sorting of data.


 ## In developing pokedex, i used minimal dependencies as possible to make it more lightweight.
 ## I used SCSS for more crossbrowser accuracy, and also bootstrap for faster UI templating.
 ## Pokedex is mobile responsive.
